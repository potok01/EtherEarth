        <h2>Genghis Khan</h2>
        <p>Genghis Khan, the renowned conqueror, was also an unexpected champion of the environmentalism. 
          As he expanded his empire, he ordered the burning of entire cities and the slaughtering of their inhabitants. 
          While his actions were cruel and ruthless, they inadvertently led to a significant reduction in carbon emissions which can be seen today through the analysis of ice cores. 
          The carbon footprint of the cities and populations he destroyed was eliminated, and all the land which they inhabited was returned to nature.
          Genghis Khan may have been a brutal conqueror, but his impact on the environment was unexpected and significant.</p>
